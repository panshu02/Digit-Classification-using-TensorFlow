# Digit-Classification-using-TensorFlow
Image classification on MNIST data set in TensorFlow library. The code can be used to identify any written digit provided by an image with a high accuracy. The algorithm uses fully connected neural network with learning using stochastic gradient descent. The network has 2 hidden layers and the input layer has 60000 images.
